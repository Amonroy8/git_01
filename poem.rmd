He grew up old school times have changed. When he was young they told him date your own race but he was his own person. He wasn't into the cholo life he grew his hair and educated himself. Times have changed back in the days you worked at it to be in a relationship. Now a days women give it away being promiscuous expecting respect or like it with be more than just a one night stand. He never said I love you unless he meant it and observed her actions how can a person say I love you but be all up on another person. Most people play the game but and up getting played. being the fool because all their shady acts catch up to them blow up in their face. Times have changed from child to adult what was cool is no more or what was a hit is now a classic. Things come and go in the blink of an eye another trend to replace the old one.
